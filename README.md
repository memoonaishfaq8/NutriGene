# NutriGene
NutriGene is a Python-based standalone app that provides personalized dietary recommendations using SNP data. It maps genetic variants to a curated nutrition knowledge base and suggests culturally relevant food choices, with a user-friendly GUI built in Tkinter.
I've Codeveloped it with @emannawz7.
